# Project 05: A Concurrent MBTA Simulator

In this project, you will implement a multi-threaded simulation of the T. In your simulation, passengers will ride trains between stations, boarding and deboarding (getting on and off) to complete their journey. Your simulation will generate a log showing the movements of passengers and trains, for example:

----------------------------------------------------------------

$ ./sim sample.json
Passenger Alice boards red at Davis
Passenger Bob boards green at Park
Train green moves from Park to Government Center
Train red moves from Davis to Harvard
Train red moves from Harvard to Kendall
Train green moves from Government Center to North Station
Train green moves from North Station to Lechmere
Train green moves from Lechmere to East Sommerville
Passenger Alice deboards red at Kendall
Train green moves from East Sommerville to Tufts
Passenger Bob deboards green at Tufts

----------------------------------------------------------------

Your simulation will be multi-threaded, with a thread for each passenger and each train. That means if you run the simulation multiple times, you may get different results depending on the scheduler! To make testing and debugging easier, you will also build a verifier that checks that the simulation result is sensible, e.g., passengers can only deboard trains at the stations the trains are at, trains must move along their lines in sequence, etc.
