# Project 03: Testing

In this project, you will develop a number of useful testing framework components. First, you will implement your own version of JUnit. (Important: You will not use JUnit in this project! You will instead implement your own version of it.) Second, you will extend your JUnit to support QuickCheck Links to an external site.-style random test generation (though to make this gradable we won't use randomness). You will undoubtedly need to use java.lang.reflect Links to an external site. in this project.
