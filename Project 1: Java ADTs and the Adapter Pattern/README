# Project 01: Java ADTs and the Adapter Pattern

This project introduces you to programming in Java by developing an abstract data type (ADT) for graphs and adapting it to a different interface using the adapter pattern. The implementation involves two main parts:

1. A graph representation using adjacency lists.

2. Adapting the graph to a new interface (EdgeGraph) using the adapter pattern.
