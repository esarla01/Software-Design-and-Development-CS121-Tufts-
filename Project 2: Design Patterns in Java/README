# Project 02: Design Patterns in Java

In this project, I implemented a chess game simulator. My simulator will take as input a file that describes the initial locations of pieces on the board and a series of moves of those pieces. It will then set up the board and execute those moves, checking that all the moves are legal and, at the end, printing the state of the game board.

The real goal of implementing this project, however, is to gain experience with design patterns. More specifically, as part of this project you I tried to implement the following patterns: Singleton, Factory, External Dependency Injection, Observer, and (Internal) Iterator.
