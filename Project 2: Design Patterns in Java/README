# Project 02: Design Patterns in Java

In this project, I implemented a **chess game simulator** in Java. The simulator takes two input files:

- A **layout file** describing the initial positions of the chess pieces.
- A **moves file** detailing a sequence of moves.

The program reads both files, sets up the board accordingly, validates each move, and prints the final state of the game board.

## Objective

While functional, the primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with **software design patterns**. Specifically, I implemented the following patterns:

- **Singleton** – to manage the board as a single shared instance.
- **Factory** – for dynamically creating chess pieces.
- **Observer** – to notify listeners of key board events (moves and captures).
- **Iterator (Internal)** – to traverse all board positions for inspection or operations.
